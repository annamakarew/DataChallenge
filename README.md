# Scroll Through the Divide: Race and Homeownership in El Dorado County

Scroll Through the Divide is a custom-built scrollytelling experience that explores racial wealth equity through the lens of Black homeownership in El Dorado County, California. Using interactive charts and narrative storytelling, the project examines how historical exclusion, income inequality, and systemic barriers shape who is able to own homes in one of Californiaâ€™s rural, majority-white regions.

This project was built as part of the Scrollytelling with Data final assignment and is intended to highlight local inequities using real-world data and custom technical implementation.

## Tools and Technologies
- Svelte: All components and scrolling logic were built using native Svelte features
- Highcharts: For custom charting (colors and sizes manually styled to match project theme)
- HTML/CSS/JS: For layout, design, and interaction logic
- GitHub Pages: For deployment

## Data Sources

Primary data from Black Wealth Data Center (BWDC)
Additional qualitative data sourced from:
- CBS: Reporting on anti-Black housing restrictions in El Dorado Hills, CA
- The New Yorker: Reporting on Black land seizure in Coloma, CA

Additional quantitative data sourced from:
- RaceCounts.org: Local racial equity indicators

## AI Tools Disclosure
I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) responsibly during the course of this project for:

- Debugging JavaScript syntax
- Generating initial layout and color palette suggestions
- Drafting and refining written narrative content (which I reviewed and edited myself)

All code, data integration, and scrollytelling logic were authored and fully understood by me, or provided in the KWK scrollytelling template.
