# Scroll Through the Divide: Race and Homeownership in El Dorado County

Scroll Through the Divide is an interactive scrollytelling project that dives into racial wealth equity by looking at Black homeownership in El Dorado County, California, which is where I’m from. Through data, charts, and storytelling, I explore how things like income gaps, historical land loss, and systemic barriers have shaped who gets to live and own property in this rural, mostly white part of the state.

I built this project for my Scrollytelling with Data final assignment for the Kode with Klossy Data Storytelling Challenge by combining design, research, and code to tell a story that’s personal, local, and backed by real data.

## Tools and Technologies
- Svelte: All components and scrolling logic were built using native Svelte features
- Highcharts: For custom charting (colors and sizes manually styled to match project theme)
- HTML/CSS/JS: For layout, design, and interaction logic
- GitHub Pages: For deployment

## Data Sources

Primary data from Black Wealth Data Center (BWDC)
Additional qualitative data sourced from:
- CBS: Reporting on anti-Black housing restrictions in El Dorado Hills, CA
- The New Yorker: Reporting on Black land seizure in Coloma, CA

Additional quantitative data sourced from:
- RaceCounts.org: Local racial equity indicators

## AI Tools Disclosure
I used ChatGPT (OpenAI) responsibly during the course of this project for:

- Debugging JavaScript syntax
- Generating initial layout and color palette suggestions
- Drafting and refining written narrative content (which I reviewed and edited myself)

All code, data integration, and scrollytelling logic were authored and fully understood by me, or provided in the KWK scrollytelling template.
